# Bakery Batch Optimizer

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

This is a react app designed for wholesale bakery stock management. It calculates and optimizes the dough batches required for large quantities of baked goods. 

There's currently no backend for this app, however I am working on adding CRUD functionally using an MVC architecture. This will use a relational database and Express.
